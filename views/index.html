                            wall when other imagery come down. I have been visited at fairs by 14 - 16 year old
                            children (both boys and girls) who were gifted a set in their toddler-hood and they tell me

                    The alphabet set was originally painted by Austin Whincup as a gift to his brother and sister-in-law
                    on the birth of their child. Austin was working as a dishwasher in London at the time, so collected
                    plastic lids from the ice-cream containers, and with the guidance of his mother back home in New
                    Zealand (early childhood teacher Joan), he would swap his gloves for his paintbrushes completed this
                    marvellous alphabet and sent it home where it was immediately hung in the new baby’s room. <br>
                    Many friends wanted a copy and one in particular, Moira Wairama, a Wellington poet and playwright
                    who also taught early childhood in Aotearoa, pretty much insisted she write a poem for each letter.
                    In doing so, “Alphabet Art” was born.
